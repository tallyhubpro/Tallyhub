# Device Assignment Feature Implementation

## ✅ **Feature Overview**

I've successfully implemented device-specific scene/source assignment functionality for the Tally Hub system. This allows you to assign individual tally devices to monitor specific sources or scenes instead of following all changes in auto mode.

## 🏗️ **Backend Implementation**

### **New Types Added:**
- `DeviceAssignment` interface for tracking assignments
- `assignmentMode` property added to `TallyDevice` ('auto' | 'assigned')
- `assignedSource`, `assignedBy`, `assignedAt` properties for tracking

### **TallyHub Enhancements:**
- **Device Assignment Management**: Track which devices are assigned to which sources
- **Smart Notification System**: Only send relevant tally updates based on assignment mode
- **Persistent Storage**: Assignments survive server restarts via `device-assignments.json`
- **Auto Mode Support**: Devices without assignments receive all tally updates

### **Key Methods Added:**
```typescript
- assignSourceToDevice(deviceId, sourceId, assignedBy)
- unassignDevice(deviceId) 
- getDeviceAssignments()
- notifyDevices() // Updated to respect assignment modes
```

### **Communication Updates:**
- **UDPServer**: Added `sendToDevice()` method for M5 stick assignment messages
- **WebSocketManager**: Made `sendToDevice()` public for web client assignments
- **Device Registration**: Automatically restores saved assignments on device connection

## 📱 **M5 Stick Firmware Support**

### **Assignment Message Handling:**
- Receives assignment notifications from Tally Hub
- Shows visual confirmation when assigned to specific sources
- Displays "ASSIGNED TO: [Source Name]" message
- Shows "AUTO MODE" when set back to auto

### **Automatic Mode Detection:**
- M5 devices default to auto mode on first connection
- Saved assignments are restored when device reconnects
- Assignment status persists across device restarts

## 🌐 **API Endpoints** (Ready to implement)

The following REST API endpoints are designed and ready to be added:

```typescript
GET    /api/devices/:deviceId/assignment     // Get device assignment status
POST   /api/devices/:deviceId/assign         // Assign device to source
DELETE /api/devices/:deviceId/assign         // Set device to auto mode  
GET    /api/assignments                      // Get all assignments
```

## 🎯 **How It Works**

### **Auto Mode (Default):**
1. Device receives **all** tally state changes
2. Shows currently active source (LIVE > PREVIEW > IDLE)
3. Perfect for operators monitoring overall system status

### **Assigned Mode:**
1. Device receives **only** updates for its assigned source
2. Shows status of assigned source regardless of other activity
3. Perfect for camera operators monitoring specific inputs

### **Assignment Process:**
1. Admin assigns device to source via web interface (to be implemented)
2. TallyHub sends assignment notification to device
3. Device shows confirmation and switches to assigned mode
4. Device now only receives updates for assigned source
5. Assignment is saved persistently

## 📊 **Device Assignment States**

| Mode | Behavior | Use Case |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Auto** | Follows all tally changes, shows currently active source | Director monitors, backup operators |
| **Assigned** | Shows only assigned source status | Camera operators, specific input monitoring |

## 🔄 **State Management**

### **Device Registration:**
- New devices default to auto mode
- Existing assignments are restored from `device-assignments.json`
- Devices receive appropriate initial tally states

### **Tally Updates:**
- Auto mode devices: Receive all tally updates
- Assigned devices: Receive only updates for their assigned source
- Efficient filtering prevents unnecessary network traffic

## 🚀 **Current Status**

### ✅ **Completed:**
- [x] TypeScript types and interfaces
- [x] TallyHub assignment logic
- [x] Device assignment persistence  
- [x] UDP/WebSocket communication
- [x] M5 stick firmware support
- [x] Auto mode fixes (previous issue resolved)
- [x] Smart tally update filtering

### 🔲 **Next Steps:**
1. **Admin Web Interface**: Add assignment management to admin panel
2. **API Routes**: Uncomment and test the REST endpoints  
3. **Web Tally Interface**: Add assignment controls to web tally page
4. **Testing**: Test assignment functionality with real OBS/vMix setups

## 🎮 **Usage Examples**

### **Camera Operator Scenario:**
```
Camera 1 Operator → Assigned to "Camera 1" input
Camera 2 Operator → Assigned to "Camera 2" input  
Director → Auto mode (sees all changes)
```

### **Multi-Scene Setup:**
```
Scene 1 Monitor → Assigned to "Main Scene"
Scene 2 Monitor → Assigned to "Backup Scene"
Technical Director → Auto mode (sees current live)
```

The foundation is now complete! The system can handle both auto mode (for overall monitoring) and assigned mode (for specific source monitoring) with full persistence and M5 stick support.

Would you like me to implement the admin web interface next to complete the user-facing assignment management?
