## Troubleshooting

### Tray Icon Issues
**Icon not visible**
- Check Windows notification area settings
- Click the up arrow (^) to show hidden icons

- Restart system if persistent issues

### Performance Issues
**High CPU usage in background**
- Check server logs for errors
- Monitor device connection status
- Restart server from tray menu

**Memory usage growing over time**
- Normal for long-running sessions
- Restart application weekly for production use
- Monitor via Windows Performance Toolkit

## Advanced Configuration

### Windows Service Deployment
For critical production environments, TallyHub can run as a Windows Service:

```cmd
# Install service wrapper
npm install -g node-windows

# Create service configuration
node service-install.js

# Start service
sc start TallyHub

# Configure service startup
sc config TallyHub start= auto
```

### Group Policy Configuration
Enterprise environments can deploy TallyHub via Group Policy:

1. **Software Installation**: Deploy MSI via Group Policy
2. **Registry Settings**: Configure auto-launch for all users
3. **Firewall Rules**: Automatic Windows Firewall configuration
4. **Update Policy**: Centralized update management

### Multi-User Setup
Configure TallyHub for multiple Windows users:

1. Install for all users during setup
2. Place configuration files in shared location
3. Set appropriate file permissions
4. Configure Windows Service for shared access

## Security Considerations

### Network Security
- Server binds to localhost by default
- Configure Windows Firewall for external access
- Use VPN for remote mixer connections
- Enable HTTPS for secure web interfaces

### File System Security
- Configuration files stored in user profile
- Logs written with appropriate permissions
- No elevation required for normal operation
- Temporary files cleaned up on exit

This Windows-specific system tray implementation transforms TallyHub into a professional background service while maintaining the familiar Windows user experience.
