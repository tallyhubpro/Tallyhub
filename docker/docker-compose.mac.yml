# macOS override for docker-compose.yml
# Docker Desktop on Mac doesn't support host networking
# Use this with: docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.mac.yml up -d

services:
  tallyhub:
    # Override host networking with bridge mode and port mapping
    network_mode: bridge
    
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"      # HTTP server
      - "7411:7411/udp"  # UDP discovery
    
    # Note: mDNS/Bonjour discovery works differently on Mac
    # Devices should be configured with your Mac's IP address
    # Find it with: ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1
