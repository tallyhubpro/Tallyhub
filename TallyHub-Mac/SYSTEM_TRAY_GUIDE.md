- Keep main window available for detailed configuration
- Monitor server status via tray icon

### Performance Tips
- Background running uses minimal resources
- Server performance unchanged when window hidden
- Tray updates are lightweight and efficient
- Full app quit only when completely done

This system tray implementation transforms Tally Hub into a true background service while maintaining easy access and control.
