## ‚öôÔ∏è Part 5: Device Assignment

### Understanding Tally States

- **üî¥ PROGRAM** (Red): Device assigned to current program/live source
- **üü¢ PREVIEW** (Green): Device assigned to preview/next source  
- **‚ö´ STANDBY** (Dark): Device not assigned or source inactive

### Assign Devices to Sources

1. **Open Admin Panel**: http://localhost:3000/admin.html

2. **View Connected Devices**:
   - Devices appear automatically when connected
   - Each shows IP address, type, and current state
   - Connection status indicator (green = connected)

3. **Assign Sources**:
   - **Drag and Drop**: Drag device to source in video mixer section
   - **Manual Assignment**: Click device ‚Üí select source dropdown
   - **Bulk Assignment**: Select multiple devices ‚Üí assign to same source

4. **Test Assignments**:
   - Switch scenes/inputs in your video mixer
   - Tallies should respond immediately (<100ms)
   - Colors change based on program/preview state

### Advanced Assignment Options

- **Multiple Devices per Source**: Multiple tallies can show same source
- **Source Aliases**: Rename sources for clearer identification  
- **Assignment Groups**: Save common assignment configurations
- **Persistent Storage**: Assignments survive server restarts

## üåê Part 6: Network Optimization

### Basic Network Setup

For most users, standard home/office WiFi works perfectly:

- **2.4GHz WiFi**: Better range, sufficient for tally data
- **5GHz WiFi**: Lower latency if devices support it
- **Wired Connection**: Use Ethernet for Tally Hub server when possible

### Professional Network Setup

For larger installations or critical productions:

1. **Dedicated VLAN**: Separate network for production equipment
2. **QoS Configuration**: Prioritize tally traffic
3. **Static IP Assignment**: DHCP reservations for critical devices  
4. **Network Monitoring**: Monitor for packet loss or high latency
5. **Backup Connectivity**: Secondary network for redundancy

### Firewall Configuration

Ensure these ports are accessible:

- **TCP 3000**: Tally Hub web interface
- **UDP 9999**: Device communication  
- **TCP 4444**: OBS WebSocket (if using OBS)
- **TCP 8088**: vMix Web Controller (if using vMix)

## üîç Part 7: Testing and Validation

### Basic Functionality Test

1. **Web Tally Test**:
   - Open tally URL on phone/tablet
   - Assign to a source in admin panel
   - Switch sources in video mixer
   - Verify immediate color changes

2. **Hardware Test**:
   - Connect ESP32/M5Stick device
   - Verify automatic discovery in admin panel
   - Assign to source and test switching
   - Check display brightness and visibility

3. **Latency Test**:
   - Record video mixer and tally simultaneously
   - Frame-by-frame analysis should show <100ms delay
   - Test under normal network load conditions

### Production Readiness Checklist

## üö® Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Devices Won't Connect

**Check WiFi Configuration**:
```bash
# Reset WiFi on ESP32 (hold BOOT button for 10 seconds during startup)
# Reconfigure through setup portal
```

**Verify Network Connectivity**:
- Ping Tally Hub server from device network
- Check firewall settings on server
- Ensure multicast is enabled on network

### Slow Tally Updates

**Network Optimization**:
- Use 5GHz WiFi if available
- Check for network congestion
- Verify QoS settings prioritize tally traffic

**Mixer Configuration**:
- Reduce polling frequency if CPU usage high
- Check mixer API response times
- Verify network path between mixer and Tally Hub

### Admin Panel Issues

**Browser Compatibility**:
- Use Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge
