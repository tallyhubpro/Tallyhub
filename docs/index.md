```mermaid
graph TB
    VM[Video Mixer<br/>OBS/vMix] --> TH[Tally Hub<br/>Server]
    TH --> WS[WebSocket<br/>Clients]
    TH --> UDP[UDP Devices<br/>ESP32/M5Stick]
    TH --> API[REST API<br/>Third Party]
    
    WS --> WEB1[Web Tally #1]
    WS --> WEB2[Web Tally #2]
    
    UDP --> ESP1[ESP32 Tally #1]
    UDP --> ESP2[ESP32 Tally #2]
    UDP --> M5[M5Stick Tally]
    
    API --> CUSTOM[Custom Integration]
```
