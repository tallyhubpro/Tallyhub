pio run --target upload

# Monitor serial output
pio device monitor
```

### Arduino IDE
1. Install required libraries:
   - `M5StickC`
   - `ArduinoJson`
   - `WebServer` (included with ESP32)
   - `DNSServer` (included with ESP32)
2. Select board: `M5Stack Arduino > M5StickC`
3. Upload the firmware

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Can't Connect to M5-Tally-Config WiFi
- Ensure M5StickC is in config mode (orange screen)
- Check WiFi password: `12345678`
- Try forgetting and reconnecting to the network
- Move closer to the M5StickC

### Configuration Page Won't Load
- Try going directly to `192.168.4.1`
- Disable mobile data on phones (use WiFi only)
- Clear browser cache
- Try a different browser

### WiFi Connection Fails After Configuration
- Double-check WiFi credentials
- Ensure M5StickC is within range of your WiFi
- Check for special characters in WiFi password
- Try 2.4GHz WiFi (5GHz not supported)

### Device Not Appearing in Tally Hub
- Verify Hub IP address is correct
- Check that UDP port 7412 is open
- Ensure M5StickC and hub are on same network
- Check hub server logs for registration attempts

### Reset to Factory Settings
1. Hold Button A during startup
2. When "Config Mode" appears, release button
3. This forces configuration mode regardless of saved settings

## üåê Network Requirements

- **WiFi**: 2.4GHz (5GHz not supported)
- **Security**: WPA/WPA2 (open networks supported but not recommended)
- **DHCP**: Device obtains IP automatically
- **Ports**: UDP 7412 for Tally Hub communication

## üìã Default Configuration

If no configuration is saved, defaults are:
```
WiFi SSID: (none - will start config mode)
WiFi Password: (none)
Hub IP: 192.168.0.216
Hub Port: 7412
Device ID: m5-tally-01
Device Name: M5 Tally Light
```

The WiFi configuration portal makes the M5 Stick Tally much more user-friendly and suitable for production environments where multiple devices need to be configured by different users.
