# Firmware Display Optimization Fixes

## Problem
The ESP32-1732S019 and M5Stick tally devices were experiencing:
- Display flicker due to frequent unnecessary updates
- Incorrect "READY" status showing when devices should display tally/source status
- Updates triggered by heartbeat acknowledgments that don't change device state

## Root Causes
1. **Frequent display updates**: Display was updating every 3 seconds regardless of whether state had changed
2. **Registration status override**: After registration confirmation, devices would show "READY" even when assigned to a source
3. **Heartbeat acknowledgment triggers**: Every heartbeat ack was potentially triggering display updates

## Solutions Applied

### ESP32-1732S019 Firmware (`firmware/ESP32-1732S019/src/main.cpp`)

1. **Extended display update interval**: Changed from 3 seconds to 30 seconds for periodic updates
   - Only updates immediately on meaningful state changes
   - Reduces unnecessary flicker by 90%

2. **Fixed registration status logic**: 
   - Prevents setting "READY" status if device is already assigned to a source
   - Maintains current tally status during registration confirmation

3. **Removed heartbeat ack display triggers**:
   - Heartbeat acknowledgments no longer cause display state changes
   - Clear comment indicating no display update needed

### M5Stick_Tally Firmware (`firmware/M5Stick_Tally/src/main.cpp`)

1. **Extended display update interval**: Changed from 3 seconds to 30 seconds
   - M5Stick firmware already had better state tracking
   - Further reduces flicker potential

2. **Verified no registration issues**: 
   - M5Stick firmware was already correctly handling registration status
   - No "READY" status override after registration

## Expected Results

- **Eliminated flicker**: Devices will only update display on meaningful state changes
- **Correct status display**: Assigned devices will maintain proper tally/source status
- **Stable operation**: Heartbeat acknowledgments won't cause unnecessary display updates
- **Better user experience**: Clean, stable status indication without annoying flicker

## Testing

Both firmware builds compile successfully:
- ESP32-1732S019: Builds without errors, merged firmware generated
- M5Stick_Tally: Builds with minor ArduinoJson deprecation warnings (non-breaking)

The updated firmware is ready for deployment and testing with actual devices.
